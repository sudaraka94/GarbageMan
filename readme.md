<p>Waste management is one of the main topics which are being thoroughly discussed in the
   current society. A lot of different methods are used in the context of waste management in
   different parts of the world. All of those methods are engineered to suit the environmental
   and social aspects of the respective region. In almost all the developed countries have paid a
   very specific attention to their waste management processes and they have been able to
   increase the efficiency of their processes using the information technologies. But the story
   about the already developing countries is different. They are using the traditional methods
   for waste management and that makes the task inefficient. This software is intended to help
   the developing countries to make their waste management processes more effective with
   the aid of modern technologies.</p>
